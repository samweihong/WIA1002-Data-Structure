public class Q3 {
    // What is a raw type?
    // A raw type is a generic class or interface used without a type parameter.

    // Why is a raw type unsafe?
    // It bypasses generic type checks during compilation and leads to runtime exceptions.

    // Why is the raw type allowed in Java?
    // To allow backward compatibilities for legacy code since generics are introduced only in JDK 5.
