It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished!
I have performed very well in the class. I am happy about it.
From DS, I learn that DS is extremely difficult.
Therefore, my target grade changes back to C.
I think I did very well in this course as this is the first course I pass.
However, the course structure could have been done better.
