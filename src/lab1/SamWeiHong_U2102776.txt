My name is Sam Wei Hong with matrix number, U2102776.
I am majoring in Data Science. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject.
At the moment, I am feeling sad about taking this subject.
This is because Data Structure can be abbreviated as DaS, and after reversing it, DaS SaD!

I acquired F for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad.
So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term.
In order to do well in the subject, I will not do poor in the subject.
Wish me luck!!!

It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished!
I have performed very well in the class. I am happy about it.
From DS, I learn that DS is extremely difficult.
Therefore, my target grade changes back to C.
I think I did very well in this course as this is the first course I pass.
However, the course structure could have been done better.
